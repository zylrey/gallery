<!-- FAQ Section -->
<div class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h5>Are there additional fees?</h5>
        <p style="background-color: #333; color: #fff;">    -NO. Full service is already included in our rates. The rate posted in each escort's profile is all-inclusive. Our girls won't ask for tips or extras.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h5>I heard there's a lot of transsexuals in the Philippines. Are all your models real females?</h5>
        <p style="background-color: #333; color: #fff;">    -YES! All our girls are 100% female and born that way. We do not hire transsexuals including post-op transsexuals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h5>I'm staying in a Sogo hotel, Victoria Court motel, or some other shady motel. Why does Jennifer refuse to send me an escort?</h5>
        <p style="background-color: #333; color: #fff;">    -Our agency attracts the best talent Manila has to offer because our girls know their safety is in good hands with us.
As per our policy, for first time customers, we only deal with 3-5 star hotels and most condos (on a case by case basis).

If you've booked a room in a condominium/apartment via a 3rd party (airbnb/booking.com/agoda), let us know so we accomodate you.

Return clientele can meet our girls at their private residence.

We do not send our models to any "love" motels (hourly rooms), drive-through establishments or any locations we feel the safety of our girls might be compromised.

If you're a first time customer, and not staying in a 3-5 star hotel or condo, feel free to ask Jennifer for a list of affordable hotels near you.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h5>Can I deal directly with your models and get their personal phone number before meeting them?</h5>
        <p style="background-color: #333; color: #fff;">-NO, the model's safety and discretion are the responsibility of the agency therefore we do not allow any direct dealing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h5>Can I get a discount? / Are your rates flexible?</h5>
        <p style="background-color: #333; color: #fff;">-Rates posted in each escort's profile are non-negotiable.

Rest assured that our rates are in fact extremely competitive considering the high quality of our ladies who are professional/part time models, pageant contestants, undergraduates & college graduates.

We don't hire street prostitutes, bar girls or cheap girls. Unlike other agencies elsewhere, our girls actually do keep the bulk of the money you give to them.

So we don't have any wiggle room to give big discounts even if we wanted to. Our girls will not work for less than the agreed rate posted in their profiles.

We do however offer great rates for bookings over 3 days. Ask Jen for more details.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h5>I only want to keep the escort for 1 hour, is it ok to just pay half?</h5>
        <p style="background-color: #333; color: #fff;">-Our minimum booking is for 2 hours. We do not offer discounts for shorter time frames.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h5>Are the models in the pictures the same person I will be meeting?</h5>
        <p style="background-color: #333; color: #fff;">-ABSOLUTELY. We know there are many agencies and "independents" in Manila with fake photos (some even use our photos and blur the faces) and what you see and what you get from them is nothing but disappointing.

Rest assured that if the model you wish for is not available, we won't "substitute/switch" with somebody else. We will simply ask you if you have a second choice and try to accommodate you accordingly.

Unlike other agencies in Manila, we don't do the old "Bait and Switch".
Furthermore, the pictures posted on the website haven't been enhanced in any way and are all recent.

Hence we even assure that we can REFUND or REPLACE any of the ladies that appear to be different persons from those in the photos.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h5>Do your models accept gifts or tips?</h5>
        <p style="background-color: #333; color: #fff;">-Our models do not expect any tips or gifts from any of our clients.

They are already happy to have been chosen by you and are content with their rate which they have chosen.

Whether you want to tip or give them a present is up to you.

This is not compulsory and even if you don't leave anything, rest assured that our models will still provide the good quality service which our agency is proud of.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h5>Do your escorts provide GFE service?</h5>
        <p style="background-color: #333; color: #fff;">-Yes, they do, but remember that hygiene plays a key role in ensuring that you have a great time with our models.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h5>Do you keep my information?</h5>
        <p style="background-color: #333; color: #fff;">-Our call logs and e-mails are deleted once your escort is finished with your rendezvous.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h5>Will a "pimp/driver" come to collect payment?</h5>
        <p style="background-color: #333; color: #fff;">-No. Our escorts arrive alone to your room to ensure discreetness. Please pay your date upon arrival so there is no awkwardness during your time together.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h5>What if I change my mind when I see my escort?</h5>
        <p style="background-color: #333; color: #fff;">-If you decide not to use your escort after letting her through your door, a transportation/cancellation fee of 1000 pesos is chargeable to cover transportation and the girl's prep time. If she stays with you more than 10 minutes, the whole booking fee applies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h5>Can I take pictures or make a video?</h5>
        <p style="background-color: #333; color: #fff;">-No. We need to protect the discretion and privacy of our models.</p>
